We have a laser focus on our students - instead of relying on enrollments and tuition hikes to make money, we focus on improving student learning and outcomes.<p>Our first class just kicked off with 32 students from all around the world. The caliber of these students is higher than the average from any university in the world. They&#x27;ve already worked at YC companies, shipped products, interned at top VC firms, and sold companies - all before entering university. They look to us to teach them about life, startups and Silicon Valley. They will look to you to teach them how to invent the future.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in building an innovative learning community for makers, email me (one of the founders) at
