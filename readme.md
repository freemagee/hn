# Responsive Hacker News

**Live Project:** [https://hn.neilmagee.com](https://hn.neilmagee.com)

## Summary

This project was first started around 2014. At that time I used [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) on my phone to read articles. It was often frustrating as the site was not designed to adapt to smaller screens (although it now appears to be).

At first I scraped the site, that kinda worked, but was hard to maintain. The current version gets it's data from two APIs (see credits).

Designed to be simple, in an easy to read view, suitable for small screens and mobile devices. Just the articles and comments.

**Note**

This is not a full like for like copy of Hacker News. Just the top 60 articles and the relevant comments are available. No accounts or anything functional is provided.

Mainly as I use this site in a browser with JavaScript disabled (I am more interested in reading the content). So it is quick to load and use.
